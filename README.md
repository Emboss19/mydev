How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution? 

As per the requirements there is a need of 3 basic components viz. **demoHaeder**,**demoContent**,**demoFooter**.

These three components are housed in a component called **demoHome**.

Now, as per further requirement there has to be a component inside of **demoContent** to display series/movies choices.
This component is **demoTitle** which shows the choices using a basic component called **demoTitlelistItem**.

Again to either go to Series page or Movies page a component is needed to list out the series or movioes records.
Thus a component called **demoTitleList** is created.


**demoTitleList** displays the first 21 entries with releaseYear  >= 2010 and sorted by the title  in ascending alphanumeric order.

So total seven components are created for demoApp.


Please see the Folder demo live screenshots

For the image demoHome
1 -> **demoHeader**
2 -> **demoContent** 
3 -> **demoFooter**

For images demoTitleList movies /series the component is **demoTitleList**


Note: There are no images given for series/movies on home page. Images are given for movie/series records.

Are there any improvements you could make to your submission? 

Yes in staylings and add different static resources and fine tuning.

What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

greatly fine tuned and improved the app.
